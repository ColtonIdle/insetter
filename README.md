# Insetter

Insetter is a library to help apps handle
[WindowInsets](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowInsets.html) more easily.
There are three libraries available:

### insetter
The base library which is written in Java.

### insetter-ktx
A Kotlin extension library, providing Kotlin specific functionality. Primarily this contains
extension functions.

### insetter-dbx
A [Data Binding][databinding] extension library, providing [Data Binding][databinding]
specific functionality. Primarily this contains binding adapters.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Attention üöß

The library is being written to production quality, but it is not adhering to semantic versioning,
mean we may change the API if needed (we'll try not to though). We're using this repository to
allow quick and easy prototyping. The contents of this library may eventually be moved into
[Android Jetpack](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-master-dev/README.md)
at a later.

## Download

```groovy
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
  // The base library. If you're using either the dbx and/or ktx libraries, you don't need this
  implementation "dev.chrisbanes:insetter:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"

  // If you're using data-binding use this
  implementation "dev.chrisbanes:insetter-dbx:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"

  // If you're using Kotlin use this too
  implementation "dev.chrisbanes:insetter-ktx:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
}
```

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository][snap].
